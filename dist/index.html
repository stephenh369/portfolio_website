      <p><em>Hello there.</em> <br> <br>
        I'm Stephen, and I am a software developer who has taken quite an unconventional path to get to where I am today. 
        It has been quite the journey...
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>I originally studied music, but after realising that ultimately it wasn't for me as a career path, the search for a new passion began.
        <br><br>
        A lot of my family were (or have) worked in the transport industry, and I'm also very enthusiastic about driving, so I thought "Why not do that for a living?". 
        <br><br>
        So for a while I became a bus driver.
        <br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Then after having drove the local buses for a couple of years I decided to take that to the next level and also become a tour guide.
        Driving into the Scottish Highlands talking non-sense about historical figures, monsters that don't exist (probably) and Scottish culture was an experience I certainly do not regret. 
        However after a while I was starting to think about finding a more scalable career.
        <br><br>
        But then the global pandemic of 2020 struck.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>After being left without work and unsure about my future, I had a lot of time to think about what I really wanted to do. 
        Regardless of how difficult or lengthy the journey would be, as time was no obstacle. <br><br>
        I remembered back to when I was a kid. When I made the decision to pursue music, there was another option, the path not taken.
        I always liked the idea of being a programmer. I originally got my first experience with coding through Scratch at high school, and remembered finding it really intriguing.
        I unfortunately had fallen into the mindset back then that programming was only for very logical and mathematical individuals where as I wanted to pursue my creative hobbies.
        <br><br>
        So out of curiousity I boot up my PC one morning and find a beginners course on Python.
        <br><br>
        I was hooked.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <p> It was from this moment on that I dedicated myself to studying programming every day. 
        After a few months of self study I began my journey through CodeClan, Scotland's only coding bootcamp as of 2020.
        <br><br>
        As of October 2020, I am now a fully qualified software developer, all within just a year, A rollercoaster of a year.
