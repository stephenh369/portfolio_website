      <p><em>Hello there.</em> <br> <br>
        I'm Stephen, and I am a software developer who has taken quite an unconventional path to get to where I am today. 
        It has been quite the journey...
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>I originally studied music, but after realising that ultimately it wasn't for me as a career path, the search for a new passion began.
        <br><br>
        A lot of my family were (or have) worked in the transport industry, and I'm also very enthusiastic about driving, so I thought "Why not do that for a living?". 
        <br><br>
        So for a while I became a bus driver.
        <br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Then after having drove the local buses for a couple of years I decided to take that to the next level and also become a tour guide.
        Driving into the Scottish Highlands talking non-sense about historical figures, monsters that don't exist (probably) and Scottish culture was an experience I certainly do not regret. 
        However after a while I was starting to think about finding a more scalable career.
        <br><br>
        But then the global pandemic of 2020 struck.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>After being left without work and unsure about my future, I had a lot of time to think about what I really wanted to do. 
        Regardless of how difficult or lengthy the journey would be, as time was no obstacle. <br><br>
        I remembered back to when I was a kid. When I made the decision to pursue music, there was another option, the path not taken.
        I always liked the idea of being a programmer. I originally got my first experience with coding through Scratch at high school, and remembered finding it really intriguing.
        I unfortunately had fallen into the mindset back then that programming was only for very logical and mathematical individuals where as I wanted to pursue my creative hobbies.
        <br><br>
        So out of curiousity I boot up my PC one morning and find a beginners course on Python.
        <br><br>
        I was hooked.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <p> It was from this moment on that I dedicated myself to studying programming every day. 
        After a few months of self study I began my journey through CodeClan, Scotland's only coding bootcamp as of 2020.
        <br><br>
        As of October 2020, I am now a fully qualified software developer, all within just a year, A rollercoaster of a year.

        <h3>React Synth.</h3>
        <p>
          React Synth is a web app synthesiser(synthesizer) using mainly React, Tone.js and the Web MIDI API. <br><br>
          For this project, I paired up with a like-minded developer to create a synth using React, it was an ambitious project considering the 1 week timeframe we had.<br><br> We were more than pleased with the result. <br><br>
          We developed this to use for our final project at CodeClan, however the project is far from over. The project also uses Express.js and MongoDB for data persistence.

        <h3>Dobble</h3>
        <p>
          Dobble (also known as Spot It!) is a popular family card game. <br><br>
          For this project, the aim was to make a browser adaption of the game as part of a small Agile team.<br><br> This is the result. <br><br>
          We undertook this project with a deadline of 1 week to use for our JavaScript group projects for our studies at CodeClan. As well as JavaScript the project also makes use of Vue, Express and MongoDB.

        <h3>The Engine Room</h3>
        <p>
          The Engine Room is a car showroom inventory CRUD app that would in theory be used by staff/management at a car showroom/dealership.<br><br>
          I undertook this project with a deadline of 1 week to use as my Ruby project for my studies at CodeClan. The tech stack consists of mainly Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL.
